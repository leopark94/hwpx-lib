# Table of Contents

You can generate table of contents with docx.js.

>Tables of Contents are fields and, by design, it's content is only generated or updated by Word. We can't do it programatically.
>This is why, when you open a the file, Word you will prompt the message "This document contains fields that may refer to other files. Do you want to update the fields in this document?".
>You have say yes to Word generate the content of all table of contents.

## Table of Contents Properties

Here is the list of all properties that you can use to generate your tables of contents.

| Option | Type | TOC Field Switch | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|captionLabel|string|\a field-argument|Includes captioned items, but omits caption labels and numbers. The identifier designated by ```text``` in this switch's field-argument corresponds to the caption label. Use \c to build a table of captions with labels and numbers.|
|entriesFromBookmark|string|\b field-argument|Includes entries only from the portion of the document marked by the bookmark named by ```text``` in this switch's field-argument.|
|captionLabelIncludingNumbers|string|\c field-argument|Includes figures, tables, charts, and other items that are numbered by a SEQ field (ยง17.16.5.56). The sequence identifier designated by ```text``` in this switch's field-argument, which corresponds to the caption label,  shall match the identifier in the corresponding SEQ field.|
|sequenceAndPageNumbersSeparator|string|\d field-argument|When used with \s, the ```text``` in this switch's field-argument defines the separator between sequence and page numbers. The default separator is a hyphen (-).|
|tcFieldIdentifier|string|\f field-argument|Includes only those TC fields whose identifier exactly matches the ```text``` in this switch's field-argument (which is typically a letter).|
|hiperlink|boolean|\h|Makes the table of contents entries hyperlinks.|
|tcFieldLevelRange|string|\l field-argument|Includes TC fields that assign entries to one of the levels specified by ```text``` in this switch's field-argument as a range having the form startLevel-endLevel, where startLevel and endLevel are integers, and startLevel has a value equal-to or less-than endLevel. TC fields that assign entries to lower levels are skipped.|
|pageNumbersEntryLevelsRange|string|\n field-argument|Without field-argument, omits page numbers from the table of contents. Page numbers are omitted from all levels unless a range of entry levels is specified by ```text``` in this switch's field-argument. A range is specified as for \l.|
|headingStyleRange|string|\o field-argument|Uses paragraphs formatted with all or the specified range of builtin heading styles. Headings in a style range are specified by ```text``` in this switch's field-argument using the notation specified as for \l, where each integer corresponds to the style with a style ID of HeadingX (e.g. 1 corresponds to Heading1). If no heading range is specified, all heading levels used in the document are listed.|
|entryAndPageNumberSeparator|string|\p field-argument|```text``` in this switch's field-argument specifies a sequence of characters that separate an entry and its page number. The default is a tab with leader dots.|
|seqFieldIdentifierForPrefix|string|\s field-argument|For entries numbered with a SEQ field (ยง17.16.5.56), adds a prefix to the page number. The prefix depends on the type of entry. ```text``` in this switch's field-argument shall match the identifier in the SEQ field.|
|stylesWithLevels|StyleLevel[]|\t field-argument| Uses paragraphs formatted with styles other than the built-in heading styles. ```text``` in this switch's field-argument specifies those styles as a set of comma-separated doublets, with each doublet being a comma-separated set of style name and table of content level. \t can be combined with \o.|
|useAppliedParagraphOutlineLevel|boolean|\u|Uses the applied paragraph outline level.|
|preserveTabInEntries|boolean|\w|Preserves tab entries within table entries.|
|preserveNewLineInEntries|boolean|\x|Preserves newline characters within table entries.|
|hideTabAndPageNumbersInWebView|boolean|\z|Hides tab leader and page numbers in web page view (ยง17.18.102).|

## Examples

```js
// Let's define the properties for generate a TOC for heading 1-5 and MySpectacularStyle,
// making the entries be hiperlinks for the paragraph
const props = new TableOfContentsProperties();
props.hiperlink = true;
props.headingStyleRange = "1-5";
props.stylesWithLevels = [new StyleLevel("MySpectacularStyle",1)]
const toc = new TableOfContents("Summary", props);

// A TableOfContents must be added via File class.
doc.addTableOfContents(toc);

doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("Header #1").heading1().pageBreakBefore());
doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("I'm a little text very nicely written.'"));

doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("Header #2").heading1().pageBreakBefore());
doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("I'm a other text very nicely written.'"));
doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("Header #2.1").heading2());
doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("I'm a another text very nicely written.'"));

doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("My Spectacular Style #1").style("MySpectacularStyle").pageBreakBefore());
